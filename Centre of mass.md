# Centre of mass

## Centre of gravity, centre of mass and centroid

**Centre of mass** A point representing the mean position of matter in a system

**Centre of gravity** A point from which the entire weight of a system can be considered to act

In a uniform gravitational field, the centre of gravity is the same as the centre of mass.  
Further, for small systems the difference between the centre of mass and centre of gravity of the system will be negligible.

**Centroid** The centre of mass of a geometric object with uniform density

## Centre of mass of a system of point masses

Suppose that there is a a set of particles, $$m_1, m_2,..., m_n$$ placed at points $$(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2),..., (x_n, y_n)$$ in a plane.

If a uniform gravitational field acts perpendicular to the plane, the resultant weight is the sum of the weights of the individual particles, and acts through the centre of mass $$G(\overline{X}, \overline{Y})$$

Taking moments about the y-axis  
$$(m_1g + m_2g _ ... m_ng)\overline{X} = m_1gx_1 + m_2gx_2 + ... + m_ngx_n $$

Hence  
$$\overline{X} = \frac{m_1gx_1 + m_2gx_2 + ... + m_ngx_n}{m_1g + m_2g + ... + m_ng}$$

Cancelling by $$g$$

$$\overline{X} = \frac{m_1x_1 + m_2x_2 + ... + m_nx_n}{m_1 + m_2 + ... + m_n}$$

This can be expressed more cleanly with sigma notation

$$\overline{X} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n m_i x_i}{\sum _{i=1} ^n m_i}$$

Resolving in each direction, and extending to three dimensions

$$\begin{pmatrix} \overline{X} \ \overline{Y} \ \overline{Z} \end{pmatrix} =  
    \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \begin{pmatrix} x\_i \ y\_i \ z\_i \end{pmatrix}}{\sum_{i=1}{n} m\_i}

$$
