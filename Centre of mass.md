# Centre of mass

## Centre of gravity, centre of mass and centroid

**Centre of mass** A point representing the mean position of matter in a system

**Centre of gravity** A point from which the entire weight of a system can be considered to act

In a uniform gravitational field, the centre of gravity is the same as the centre of mass.
Further, for small systems the difference between the centre of mass and centre of gravity of the system will be negligible.

## Centre of mass of a system of point masses

## Centre of mass of simple shapes

## Centre of mass of conjoined shapes

## Centres of mass of non uniform shapes

## Suspended shapes
