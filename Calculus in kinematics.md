# Calculus in kinematics

## Velocity at an instant

**Displacement** A vector referring to the difference between an objects position and its original position

**Distance **A scalar value referring to how far an object has moved during its motion

**Velocity** The rate of change of displacement with respect to time $$v = \frac{dx}{dt}$$

**Acceleration **The rate of change of velocity with respect to time $$a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2}$$

It follows that

$$x = \int v\ dt$$ and $$v = \int a\ dt$$

## Variable forces

Bodies have variable acceleration as a result of being subject to variable forces. An example of a variable force is air resistance, which is proportional to the velocity of the object.

Newton's second law links applied force to acceleration as $$F = ma$$ where $$m$$ is the mass of the object.

## Motion in two and three dimensions

In more than one direction, each quantity can be represented as the sum of the products of the values in each dimension and their respective unit vectors.

For the &lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt; direction, the unit vector is $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$$ in two dimensions, and $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$$ in three dimensions. A vector is then expressed as a sum of products of the unit vectors.

$$\textbf{r} = x\textbf{i} + y\textbf{j} + z\textbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}$$

The magnitude of the vector can then be found using Pythagoras' theorem

$$|\textbf{r}| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$$

For each component in multidimensional motion, the same techniques used in single dimensional motion are applied.

Thus

$$\textbf{v} = \frac{dx}{dt}\textbf{i} + \frac{dx}{dt}\textbf{j} + \frac{dx}{dt}\textbf{j}$$

and 

$$\textbf{a} = \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2}\textbf{i} + \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2}\textbf{j} + \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2}\textbf{j}$$

When the components are written as functions of time, this is expressed as

$$\textbf{r} = f(t)\textbf{i} + g(t)\textbf{j} + h(t)\textbf{k} \\ 
\textbf{v} = f'(t)\textbf{i} + g'(t)\textbf{j} + h'\textbf{k} \\
\textbf{a} = f''(t)\textbf{i} + g''(t)\textbf{j} + h''\textbf{k}$$
