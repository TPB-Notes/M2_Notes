# Work, energy, and power

## Work

**Work** The work done by a force is the magnitude of the force multiplied by the distance through which the point of application of the force moves. (J)

The SI unit of work, the joule (J) is defined as the amount of work done when a force of 1 newton moves a distance of 1 metre.

### Work done against gravity

Suppose an object of mass $$m$$ is raised at constant speed by a force $$T$$.
Resolving vertically $$T - mg = 0$$ and hence $$T = mg$$.

If the mass is raised through a distance $$h$$, the work done against gravity is then $$mgh$$

### Work done by a force at an angle

Forces may be applied at an angle to the direction in which displacement occurs, such as when an object is dragged along a surface using a rope inclined to the horizontal.

The work done by the force is then the component of the force acting in the direction of movement, multiplied by the distance moved in that direction.

For a force $$F$$ the work done by $$F$$ is $$Fs\times cos(\theta)$$

As $$F$$ and $$s$$ are vectors, this can be written in vector form as work done $$= |F||s|cos(\theta)$$.

## Energy

## Gravitational potential energy

When an object is moved through a gravitational field, it has  gravitational potential energy.
