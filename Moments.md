# Moments

**Moment** A moment is a force multiplied by the perpendicular distance to the point around which it is acting

## Turning forces

When a force **F** acts at a perpendicular distance _d_ from an axis that is perpendicular to the plane, the turning effect of the force about the axis as magnitude |**F**| x _d_ .
This turning effect is the moment of the force, or the torque.
The unit of the moment of the force is newton metres (N m).

### Direction of turning forces

It is generally accepted that the positive rotational direction is anticlockwise, and that a negative rotation is anticlockwise.

### Multiple turning forces

When several forces act in the same plane, their total turning effect about a given point is the sum of the moments of the individual forces

### Forces at an angle

When a force is not acting entirely parallel to an object, the component of the force which is parallel to the object must be resolved. This is done by splitting the force into its components.

### Force vectors

Forces may be written as vectors with each value representing the action of the force in a particular direction.

## Parallel forces

**Principle of moments** The total moment of a system of forces about any point is equal to the moment of the resultant force of the system about that point

There are three possible situations when forces act along parallel lines

1. The sum of the forces is non zero.  The system of forces is then equal to a single resultant force which can be found by the principle of moments
2. The sum of the forces is zero, and the total moment of the forces about any point is also zero. The system of forces is then in equilibrium
3. The sum of the forces is zero but the total moment of the forces is non-zero. This can happen when there are two equal forces in parallel which are acting in opposite directions. This is a couple
